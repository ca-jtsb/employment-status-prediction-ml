# Employment Status Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employment data to predict the employment status of individuals based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. The dataset used in this study is derived from the **April 2016 Philippine Labor Force Survey (LFS) Public Use File**, which contains detailed information on employment conditions, work characteristics, and job-seeking behavior.

By leveraging machine learning classification techniques, this project aims to model employment outcomes and identify key factors that influence employment status. The results of this analysis can provide insights into labor market trends and support data-driven decision-making for researchers, policymakers, and economists.

## Objectives

* Analyze socio-economic and demographic factors related to employment
* Build and compare machine learning models for employment status prediction
* Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics
* Identify important features influencing employment outcomes

## Dataset

* **Source:** April 2016 Philippine Labor Force Survey (LFS) Public Use File
* **Description:** Contains individual-level data on employment status, work conditions, and job-seeking behavior
* 
> Note: The dataset is used strictly for academic and educational purposes.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Statistical analysis and visualization to understand patterns and relationships
3. **Feature Selection** – Correlation-based and relevance-driven feature selection
4. **Model Training** – Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
5. **Model Evaluation** – Performance comparison using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices

## Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest
* Neural Network

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter / Google Colab**
* **pandas, NumPy**
* **scikit-learn**
* **matplotlib / seaborn**

## Results

The models were evaluated and compared based on their predictive performance and generalization ability. The analysis highlights key socio-economic variables that significantly influence employment status and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in labor market analysis.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Ensure required Python libraries are installed
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the results
